My version is almost a one 2 one copy of Peter his program the only different aspect is: custom screen options.

My dad complains that after he upgrade his video card he could get Peter's version working correct.

So i looked at the application and told my dad that i could code that in one day and make it better.
I took this challenge because i written some code for custom screen options before.

My version got all basic functions that peter's version got i left out the RGB options because otherwise i couldn't make the dead line of one day :-D


If you select view set location Testbeeld you get another window and you can drag it to the desired screen/location...
after hitting the Set button the location is fixed.

 
If you hit the fullscreen button it will load the Test card/screen on that location.
 
Some more test card options:
